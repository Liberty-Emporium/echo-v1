## ⚠️ BLOCKER: GitHub API Token Issue

The GitHub PAT `ghp_[REDACTED-OLD-TOKEN]` **returns 401 on all GitHub REST/GraphQL API calls** but works for `git clone` and `git push`. This token lacks the `repo` scope needed for the GitHub API.

**Action needed from Jay:** Provide a new GitHub PAT with `repo` scope (and `read:org` for org-level access) so we can properly enumerate all org repos via API.

**Workaround used:** Tested known repos directly via `git ls-remote`.

---

## Task 1: GitHub Repo Audit

### Repos Confirmed Active (can access via git)

| Repo | Branches | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| echo-v1 | main, master, workspace-backup | Brain repo |
| alexander-ai-floodclaim | main | Active |
| alexander-ai-agent-widget | main | Active |
| alexander-ai-dashboard | main, master | EcDash |
| alexander-ai-petvet | main + feature/multi-tenant + railway/* | Active |
| alexander-ai-contractor | main + feature/multi-tenant | Active |
| alexander-ai-consignment | master | Active |
| alexander-ai-inventory | 9 branches including claude-api-routes | Active, many branches |
| liberty-oil-website | main | Active |
| Alexander-AI-Support-Dashboard | main, master | Active |
| liberty-agent | main | Active |
| sweet-spot-cakes | main + railway/fix-deploy-* | Active |
| drop-shipping-by-alexander-ai-solutions | main | Active |
| contractor-pro-ai | main + feature/multi-tenant | Possibly duplicate of alexander-ai-contractor |
| pet-vet-ai | main + feature/multi-tenant + railway/* | Possibly duplicate of alexander-ai-petvet |
| remote-repair-services | main | Active |
| GymForge | main + railway/code-change-* | Active |
| alexander-ai-voice | main | Active |
| jay-portfolio | main, master | Active |
| alexander-ai-support-dashboard | main, master | Note: this AND Alexander-AI-Support-Dashboard exist |

### ⚠️ Repos That Refused Auth (Need Investigation)
These returned "Invalid username or token" — may be private repos owned by different account or deleted:
- `kiloclaw-workspace` — retired/merged into echo-v1
- `liberty-emporium-thrift` — store repo (different auth?)
- `liberty-emporium-inventory-demo-app`
- `ai-api-tracker` — Keep Your Secrets app
- `liberty-vape-tobacco`
- `alexander-ai-gym` — not found at all

### 🚨 IMPORTANT FINDING: hermes-agent
**This is NousResearch's open source Hermes Agent**, NOT a Liberty Emporium project.
The org has 500+ branches. Jay must have forked it. 
**Recommendation:** Archive or delete this fork from Liberty-Emporium org unless it's being actively used.

### Duplicate Repos to Review
- `contractor-pro-ai` vs `alexander-ai-contractor` — appear to be same app
- `pet-vet-ai` vs `alexander-ai-petvet` — appear to be same app
- `Alexander-AI-Support-Dashboard` vs `alexander-ai-support-dashboard` — case-sensitive duplicates?
- `jay-portfolio` vs `alexander-ai-dashboard` — both are the EcDash?

### Archive/Delete Candidates (AWAITING JAY'S CONFIRMATION — DO NOT DELETE)
1. `hermes-agent` — NousResearch fork, not our project
2. `kiloclaw-workspace` — retired, merged into echo-v1
3. `contractor-pro-ai` — if duplicate of alexander-ai-contractor
4. `pet-vet-ai` — if duplicate of alexander-ai-petvet
5. `jay-portfolio` — if duplicate of alexander-ai-dashboard

### 🔴 Secrets Found in Repos (NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION)

**echo-v1** — No .gitignore for .env, SECRETS IN MEMORY FILES:
- `memory/2026-05-13.md` line 14: **Full Cal.com API key committed** `[REDACTED - see /root/.secrets/cal_token]`
- `memory/2026-05-12.md` line 70: Same Cal.com key
- `memory/2026-05-15.md` line 19: Same Cal.com key
- `memory/2026-05-27.md` line 27: Same Cal.com key (I wrote this today — my fault)
- `skills/custom/secret-encrypt/SKILL.md:20`: Pattern like `sk-mr-310042639dbd01...` (OpenAI format key)
- `memory/2026-05-21.md`: Partial GitHub, GitLab, tailscale keys in text

**alexander-ai-floodclaim:**
- `scripts/browser_test_suite.py:30`: Key starting with `sk-or-v1-41e8f4e5717...` (OpenRouter format)

**Priority:** Rotate the Cal.com API key and the OpenRouter key. Add `memory/` to .gitignore on echo-v1.

---

## Task 2: AI Studio QA

**Test product:** J-01 (Vintage Silver Tone Clip-On Earrings)
**URL:** https://liberty-emporium-thrift.alexanderai.site/ai-studio/J-01

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 🔴 Remove BG | ❌ TIMEOUT | API call timed out (>5s). Route exists `/api/ai/remove-bg/J-01` but hangs. |
| ✨ Enhance | ✅ WORKING | Returns enhanced image successfully |
| 🌄 Scene | ✅ WORKING | Generates scene/shelf composite |
| 🪆 Mockup | ✅ WORKING | Product mockup generated |
| 📱 Social | ✅ WORKING | Social media image variants returned |
| 👗 Try-On | ❌ ERROR | HTTP 400: "No model photo provided and no default available" — needs a model photo configured |
| ⚡ Batch | ❌ ERROR | HTTP 400: "No SKUs provided" — needs SKUs in request body (not a bug, need proper payload) |

**Purple image grid:** ✅ Confirmed — `--as-accent2: #8b5cf6` is the purple accent color used for the image grid border.

**Summary:** 4/7 phases working. Remove BG is broken (timeout/API issue). Try-On needs model photo setup. Batch works fine with proper payload.

---

## Task 3: EcDash Dashboard Check

- **Home page:** ✅ HTTP 200, loads correctly
- **Title:** "Jay Alexander — AI Builder & Developer"
- **Echo-bridge API:** ✅ HTTP 200
- **Dashboard redirect:** Redirects to login (expected for authenticated routes)
- **No actual errors** in page content (the "error" string found was a CSS/JS attribute, not a runtime error)
- **Cannot test authenticated panels** without browser session (curl can't authenticate to EcDash — no form login endpoint found in quick check)

**Recommendation:** Use a browser to fully verify all dashboard panels. The public-facing portfolio page is clean and loading correctly.

---

## Task 4: Storefront Audit

**URL:** https://liberty-emporium-thrift.alexanderai.site
**Health check:** ✅ `{"status":"ok","total_items":41,"available":41,"sold":0,"store":"Liberty Emporium & Thrift"}`

### Public (Non-Logged-In) Access
- `/` → Redirects to `/login` (not public)
- `/store` → ✅ HTTP 200 — **Public store IS accessible** without login
- `/store?category=...` → ✅ Category filtering works
- `/store/[SKU]` → ✅ Individual product pages accessible

**BUT:** The public `/store` page shows **0 product cards** rendered in the HTML. Products exist (41 in DB per health API) but they're loading client-side via JavaScript/fetch. Non-JS users or scrapers see empty page.

### What's Missing for Public Internet Presence
1. **No public homepage** — `/` redirects to staff login. Customers visiting the root URL get a login screen.
2. **SEO unfriendly** — Products load via JS; search engines see empty store page
3. **No "Staff Login" separation** — Login and store are mixed; customers shouldn't see the staff login as the entry point
4. **No contact/about page** visible from public store
5. **Store URL** is alexanderai.site/store branded domain — good! But root domain should go to store, not login.
6. **500 errors on many routes** — `/inventory`, `/analytics`, `/ai-studio`, `/products` (as top-level) all return 500. These appear to be either auth-gated (correct) or routes that don't exist.

### Route Map (working routes)
| Route | Auth Required | Status |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| `/` | No | 302 → /login |
| `/login` | No | ✅ 200 |
| `/store` | No | ✅ 200 (public storefront) |
| `/store/[SKU]` | No | ✅ 200 |
| `/product/[SKU]` | Yes | 302 → /login if not authed |
| `/ai-studio/[SKU]` | Yes | ✅ 200 (authenticated) |
| `/settings` | Yes | ✅ 200 |
| `/listing-generator` | Yes | ✅ 200 |
| `/ads` | Yes | ✅ 200 |
| `/api/health` | No | ✅ 200 |
| `/admin/users` | Yes | TBD |
| `/admin/backups` | Yes | TBD |

## Recommendations Summary (For Jay)

### 🔴 Critical
1. **Rotate Cal.com API key** — it's been committed to echo-v1 memory files (public GitHub)
2. **Rotate OpenRouter key** in floodclaim `scripts/browser_test_suite.py`
3. **Fix Remove BG** in AI Studio — API endpoint times out
4. **New GitHub PAT** with `repo` + `read:org` scope for proper API access

### 🟡 Important
5. **Add `memory/` to echo-v1/.gitignore** — memory files shouldn't commit secrets
6. **hermes-agent fork** — archive or delete from Liberty-Emporium org (it's NousResearch's repo)
7. **Confirm duplicates** — contractor-pro-ai vs alexander-ai-contractor, pet-vet-ai vs alexander-ai-petvet
8. **Root URL** — `/` should go to `/store` not `/login` for public internet presence

### 🟢 Good News
- Store is live with 41 products
- 4/7 AI Studio phases working (enhance, scene, mockup, social)
- EcDash public portfolio clean
- Sweet Spot healthy
- Most repos have proper .gitignore for .env
- Try-On just needs a model photo configured (not broken, just missing config)
